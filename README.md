## üèó Setup

### magiskboot

Although bootwitch are powered by `magiskboot`, it doesn't comes with the `magiskboot` binary by default.<br />
The main purpose of it is so you can decide what version of `magiskboot` by yourself.<br />
So, before anything else, you need to put your preferred `magiskboot` binary file inside the `external/` folder.

### kernel related files

Like anykernel2, you can put your `Image.gz-dtb` (and `dtbo.img` if you also want to flash that) to the root of bootwitch folder.

### Specific kernel configuration (kernel.conf)

There is several things that you can configure in the [`kernel.conf`](kernel.conf).

```sh
kernelid=
```
Used by [`buildzip.sh`](buildzip.sh) for naming your zip files. required if you're using [`buildzip.sh`](buildzip.sh) for building zip file.

```
kernelname=
kernelver=
kernelauthor=
```
Informations of your kernel release. it will be displayed in the installation process. OR :

```
banner_mode=
```
If you want to use your own banner at [`banner.txt`](banner.txt), you can set `banner_mode` to `custom`.<br />
It will display the content of [`banner.txt`](banner.txt) instead the default information.

```
blk_boot=
src_kernel=
```
Define your kernel filename, and where the `boot` device block on it.

```
with_dtbo=
blk_dtbo=
src_dtbo=
```
If your kernel release also provide the `dtbo.img`, you can enable `with_dtbo=true`.<br />
Don't forget to set the `dtbo` device block on `blk_dtbo`, and dtbo filename on `src_dtbo`.<br />
If not, then just set it to `false`.

```
preserve_magisk=
```
Mostly, custom kernel on system-as-root devices doesn't patch their initramfs.c ([@okitavera](https://github.com/okitavera) does, hehehe).<br />
Basically, in order preserve magisk functionality on system-as-root device, you need to hexpatch it like Magisk does.<br />
But don't worry, we got you.<br />
You just need to set it `true` to let the witch (and of course, `magiskboot`) does the job.

## üì¶ Building zip file

bootwitch comes with [`buildzip.sh`](buildzip.sh) to generate zip easily.<br />
If you're already setup all things ([`kernel.conf`](kernel.conf), `external/magiskboot`, `Image.gz-dtb`, and maybe `dtbo.img`),<br />
you can just run the script directly in your `bootwitch` folder.

```sh
./buildzip.sh
```
